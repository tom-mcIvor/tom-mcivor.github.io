## HTML


### This is the building blocks of my website i find this to be easy enough its just going div.container or span.cotainer or sometimes theres a form which my have inputs  





## CSS


#### This is also not too bad at least to get something to happen. To get exactly what you want is hard however. The problem for when it comes to CSS is how hard it can be to get something simple eg: A simple centered line of text or an image inside a div container. This surely is the blocks anyone needs to make a website.... in order to just make this text/image centered inside the box you need to run this rather tendious and long winded CSS 

      #selector { 
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
  }
