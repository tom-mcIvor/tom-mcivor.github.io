## HTML


#### This is the building blocks of my website i find this to be easy enough its just going div.container or span.cotainer or sometimes theres a form which my have inputs  





## CSS


#### This is also not too bad at least to get something to happen. To get exactly what you want is hard however. 

#### The problem for me when it comes to CSS is how hard it can be to get something simple eg: A simple centered line of text or an image inside a div container. This surely is the blocks anyone needs to make a website.... in order to make just this simple text/image centered inside the box you need to run this rather tendious and long winded CSS code;

      #selector { 
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
  }

#### I guess this is where a Framework like bulma or bootstrap can come in and help. But how many people use these and will these framworks be free and translatable/transposable for my future projects?
