    <p><h3>Definition:</h3></p>
    <p>
    Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
  </p>

  <p><h3>It's important..</h3></p>
  <p>Without knowing how to regulate our emotions and to stretch our discomfort, we’re limited in our personal and professional growth, relationships, and fulfillment in our lives. And when humans feel contained, we’ll also feel stuck, hopeless, complacent, lonely, even bitter, which plays a large part in many of our social issues today.</p>
  <p><h3>My thoughts</h3></p>
  <p>Emotional IQ is the hardest thing to deal with as it gets to the core of why people act in certain ways. this is the reason why people find it hard to study while others dont have a problem with it. Its about how the brain wroks around the enviroment very complicated.
    In general people have the same kind of ideas and thoughts as we are genetically so much the same. 
    Also Its important to realise that this topic while helpful is different from writing code
