      <p> What is your long term goal or career pathway?
       A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
      <p>Just to get a job to start with</p>
      <p>My limitations are that i only have so much time</p>

       <p> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
      <p>I think it's pretty much too late to 'develop' my non-technical skills</p>
      <p>they will change based on what environment i'm in, I am who I am</p>
       <p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
       <p>Just study and plod away at the given tasks</p>
      
       <p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
      <p>Well if I get stuck then I will use the facilitaors to help me. If another student wants to help then thats a bonus</p>
      <p>Likewise I will offer my help if needed</p>


      <p>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        <p>Clear instuctions and useful help if I need it</p>


      <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
      <p>Just some randomly timed sport</p>
