      <p class="qustion">  What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <ul>
        <p>My learning goals are to learn enough html css and js to get a job</p>
        <p class="reflection">This goal is still the same which is to gain knowledge and skills through all the learning modules that come up. I want to get employment in the web development industry. Find a job I like and can fit in to a team.</p>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="qustion"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?
       A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
       <ul>
      <p>Just to get a job to start with</p>
      <p>My limitations are that i only have so much time</p>
  
        <p class="reflection">My strengths are that I keep trying. It took me more than one time of applying to get accepted on to this course.  When I was at university I stuck at it when I found studying got harder and harder. One thing that was a limitation to my learning was I became so anxious and stressed at exams times that my performance suffered. I still find deadlines hard but I now try to pace myself.      I need to work longer hours to get the work done.</p>
</ul>

       <p class="qustion"> What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>


      <ul>
        <p>I think it's pretty much too late to 'develop' my non-technical skills
        they will change based on what environment i'm in, I am who I am</p>
        <p class="reflection">I think I have gone ahead with my technical skills and maybe feel i bit short of were I wanted to get to. There were lots of interesting modules and I kept up with the work load. In the human skills I have tried to take part in the team work and group projects. There have been things that I haven’t done before like the remote learning and the presentations.</p>
      </ul>

       <p class="qustion">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
       <ul>
         <p>Just study and plod away at the given tasks</p>
         
         <p class="reflection">I gave up full time work doing admin with the DHB Covid team that I’d had for over a year. I needed to have my full focus on the course and spend all my time on keeping up with the workload. I was able to stay at home which helped and I had no distractions like flatmates or planned social events. I have plodded away and tried to keep up even when I felt I hit the wall a few times. I have been able to work in the weekends to go over stuff I learned through the week.</p>
       </ul>


       <p class="qustion">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Well if I get stuck then I will use the facilitaors to help me. If another student wants to help then thats a bonus</p>
        <p>Likewise I will offer my help if needed</p>
        <p class="reflection">Well I did get stuck quite a few times. I accepted the help of a tutor and asked questions all the time. I am much better at asking for help now than I was at first. Lots of the others doing the course have helped me when I have reached out which was good.</p>
      </ul>


      <p class="qustion">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        <ul>
          <p>Clear instuctions and useful help if I need it</p>
          <p class="reflection">I work best if I know exactly what is expected.  I find it hard to guess what is wanted so I need clear directions. Bullet points or lists help me get organised. Some of the jargon is hard to get my head around.  </p>
        </ul>


      <p class="qustion">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Just some randomly timed sport</p>
        
        <p class="reflection">No I have not had any commitments that I needed to plan into my day.                 I still worked when the power was out in our street for a whole day. I was pleased that I managed to work something out so I could still join in but I was out of my comfort zone that day.</p>

        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Just to get a job
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">Already discussed</p>
      <h3>
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        limitations: i only have 24 hours in the day
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">Reflecting on my strength of keeping trying and never giving up.</p>

<p class="reflection">I have found the pace frantic and really hard to keep up with. The human skills component was a rocky road for me but I have developed some coping skills. I still worry and get anxious but have learned to let go of things that I can’t change.</p>
      <h3>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        sleeping 
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">Yes, because I work late I have found it hard to wind down and getting to sleep was a problem. Towards the end of bootcamp I woke up tired and it took me a while to get started.</p>
      <h3>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Don't know 
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">I have learnt in this course that focus is a big issue and when problems come up that I can’t change I need to keep going and not let distractions get the better of me.</p>
      <h3>
      What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h3>
      <p>
        They should be doing the work, I dont want someone thats been on holiday for foundations asking week 2 questions
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">That the team want me to be successful and will help me reach my goal of graduating and getting a job.</p>
